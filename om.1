Alternative configuration location if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set.

.TP
.I ~/.config/om/programs.json.backup
Automatic backup created when the configuration file is corrupted.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B XDG_CONFIG_HOME
If set, om will use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/om/programs.json instead of 
~/.config/om/programs.json.

.SH NOTES
.PP
Program names that conflict with built-in commands (add, delete, list, etc.) 
are considered reserved. If you add a program with a reserved name, you must 
use the explicit 
.B run
command to execute it.

.PP
When adding programs, om validates that the command exists in your PATH or as 
a file. Use the 
.B \-f/\-\-force 
flag to skip this validation.
